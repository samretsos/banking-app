"""Application entry point.

Run it with:  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Interactive docs:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Needs a database. First time, or after pulling:

    cp .env.example .env          # once
    docker compose up -d --wait
    python -m scripts.seed        # optional demo accounts

Tables are created automatically on startup from `app/tables.py`. That only adds
tables that do not exist yet — altering an existing one needs a manual ALTER.

Every router is registered here already, including the ones that are still empty.
That is on purpose: it means nobody has to edit this file to add their endpoints,
so several people can work in parallel without colliding on it.
